- 👋 Hello you sexy people, I’m J.
- 👀 I’m interested in combining in-depth expertise about governance, policy, and regulation with some very cool data analysis and manipulation skills.
- 🌱 To this end, I’m currently re-learning and learning various programming languages while re-shuffling life plans a bit. Been wanting to do it for a while and COVID gave me just the right kind of motivation for it. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate just yet, but I'll be looking out for collaborations pretty soon...
- 📫 You can contact me here or via one of my other social networks (they're all in my website).
