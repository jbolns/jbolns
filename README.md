👋 Hello sexy people, I’m J.

👽 Coder. Political Economist.

🌱 Currently trying to develop cool things, while continuously learning about digital technologies.

💡 My biggest lesson thus far is that coding is increasingly becoming a team effort. The really cool things take a team, indeed. I started my coding journey independently. Now trying to be part of something cool. 

💞️ What is cool? High-performance websites (cool, yet fast and extremely efficient), digital sustainability, edge AI, among many other things... It's a long list.

📫 You can contact me here or via social media.
