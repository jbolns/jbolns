👋 Hello sexy people, I’m J.

👽 Currently trying to develop cool things.

💞️ What is cool? High-performance websites (beautiful, interactive, multilingual, yet fast and sustainable), edge AI, anything 3D, and, most recently but already very fond of it, quantum computing.

💡 My biggest lesson thus far is that coding is increasingly a team effort. I started my coding journey independently. Would now like to change that.

📫 You can contact me here or via social media.
