👋 Hello sexy people, I’m J.

👽 Coder. Political Economist.

🌱 Currently trying to develop cool things, while also continuously learn about digital technologies.

💡 My biggest lesson thus far is that coding is increasingly a team effort. The really cool things take a team. I started my coding journey independently. Would now like to be part of something cool.

💞️ What is cool? High-performance websites (cool, yet fast and extremely efficient), digital sustainability, edge AI, among many other things (it's a long list).

📫 You can contact me here or via social media.
