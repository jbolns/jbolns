- 👋 Hello sexy people, I’m J.
- 👀 Used to be a policy expert, now knee-deep into coding. Maybe one day I'll fork-join these two life paths. 
- 🌱 Currently have a small (tiny) software development firm. Trying to produce cool things. Trying to keep it open-source. 
- 💞️ Would love to collaborate with anyone interested in high-performance website development, digital sustainability, or both.
- 📫 You can contact me here or via social media.
