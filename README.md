👋 Hello sexy people, I’m J.
👽 Used to be a policy expert, now knee-deep into coding. Maybe one day I'll fork-join these two life paths. 

💻 My favourite languages are Python, JS, SQL, and, oddly, VBA. That said, my main advantage is that I can adapt as needed. If I know it, I know it. If I don't, I figure it out.
🌱 I also can help you approach your digital strategy in a way that keeps society and sustainability in mind.

💞 Would love to collaborate with anyone interested in high-performance website development, digital sustainability, or both.
📫 You can contact me here or via social media.
