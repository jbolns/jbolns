- 👋 Hello sexy people, I’m J.
- 👀  I was an academic for a bit. Politics, economics, and whatnot. I am now amongst probably-few political economists who can talk shop with programmers and data engineers.
- 🌱 Currently in my first year flying solo with a small (tiny) business in the digital technology/sustainability space.
- 💞️ Would love to collaborate with anyone in this field. 
- 📫 You can contact me here or via social media.
